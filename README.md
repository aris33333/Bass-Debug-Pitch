Thesis work on Bass Pickup Effects on Pitch Manipulation

The research aims to understand the effects a bass guitar pickup has when the output signal is pitch manipulated by either shifting or synthesizing. The outcome is not necessarily providing an outright answer on the better pickup to use for such applications, but rather understand if any profound effects are being produced when different types of pickups are used. Furhtermore, it also serves a platform on understanding Digital Signal Processing and various hardware optimizations that can be implemented when an embedded signal processing unit is implemented within an instument such as bass guitars.
